# Container Management: A Comprehensive Tutorial

## Introduction

Containers have revolutionized how we develop, deploy, and manage applications. Unlike traditional virtualization, containers share the host system's kernel while providing isolated environments for applications. This tutorial will guide you through container management fundamentals, from basic operations to advanced orchestration techniques.

## Container Basics

### Container Lifecycle

The container lifecycle follows several distinct phases:

1. **Creation**: A container is created from an image but not yet started
2. **Running**: The container is actively executing processes
3. **Paused**: Container processes are temporarily suspended
4. **Stopped**: The container has exited but still exists
5. **Removed**: The container is permanently deleted

Here's a practical example using Docker:

```bash
# Create a container without starting it
docker create --name my-container nginx

# Start the container
docker start my-container

# Pause the container
docker pause my-container

# Unpause the container
docker unpause my-container

# Stop the container
docker stop my-container

# Remove the container
docker rm my-container
```

### Container States

Containers can exist in various states:

- **Created**: Container exists but hasn't been started
- **Running**: Container processes are active
- **Paused**: Container processes are temporarily suspended
- **Exited**: Container has completed execution or was stopped
- **Dead**: Container failed to complete properly

To check the state of all containers:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

Sample output:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                     PORTS                  NAMES
1a2b3c4d5e6f   nginx     "/docker-entrypoint.â€¦"   5 minutes ago   Up 5 minutes               0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp     web-server
7g8h9i0j1k2l   redis     "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   3 hours ago     Exited (0) 2 hours ago                            redis-cache
```

### Container Operations

Common container operations include:

- **Inspecting**: View detailed information about a container
- **Executing**: Run commands inside a running container
- **Attaching**: Connect to a running container's main process
- **Logs**: View the container's output logs

Examples:

```bash
# Inspect container details
docker inspect my-container

# Execute a command in a running container
docker exec -it my-container bash

# Attach to a running container
docker attach my-container

# View container logs
docker logs my-container

# Follow logs in real-time
docker logs -f my-container
```

### âœ… What `docker attach` _does_:

When you run:

```bash
docker attach <container_name>
```

you are attaching your terminal **directly to the container's primary process**. This means:

- Anything the container outputs to stdout/stderr is shown in your terminal.
- Any input you type goes to the container's stdin (if it's open).
- If you press `Ctrl+C`, you send a `SIGINT` (interrupt signal) to the main process of the container â€” which often stops it.

---

### ðŸ¤” So what's the real use of `docker attach`?

`docker attach` is useful in **very specific situations**, such as:

1. **Debugging or monitoring** simple containers:

   - For example, containers running an interactive shell or single foreground process like `nginx`, `node`, etc., where you want to watch logs or interact with input directly.

2. **Attaching to containers started in interactive mode**:

   - When a container is started with `-it` (interactive + TTY), attach lets you re-enter that interactive session.

3. **Temporarily monitoring logs in real-time**:

   - For short-term inspection, though `docker logs -f <container>` is usually better for this.

---

### ðŸ›‘ Why it's _not_ often used in production:

- **It's easy to accidentally stop the container** if you hit `Ctrl+C`.
- Not suitable for long-term log monitoring or shell access.

---

### âœ… Better Alternatives:

1. **To view logs without attaching**:

   ```bash
   docker logs -f <container_name>
   ```

2. **To run commands inside the container** without affecting the main process:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it <container_name> bash
   ```

### Resource Management

Containers use resources from the host system, including:

- CPU
- Memory
- Storage
- Network

You can specify resource constraints when running containers:

```bash
# Memory constraints
docker run -m 512m             # Limit to 512MB memory
docker run --memory=1g         # Limit to 1GB memory
docker run --memory-swap=2g    # Set swap limit to 2GB
docker run --memory-reservation=512m  # Soft limit of 512MB

# CPU constraints
docker run --cpus=1.5         # Limit to 1.5 CPU cores
docker run --cpu-shares=512   # Relative CPU share (default 1024)
docker run --cpuset-cpus=0-3  # Run on CPUs 0-3
docker run --cpu-period=100000 --cpu-quota=50000  # Advanced CPU limiting

# Storage constraints
docker run --storage-opt size=10G  # Limit container storage (if storage driver supports it)
docker run --device-write-bps /dev/sda:1mb  # Limit write rate to 1MB/s
docker run --device-read-iops /dev/sda:1000 # Limit read operations to 1000 IOPS

# Combined example
docker run -d \
  --name resource-limited-app \
  --memory=1g \
  --memory-swap=2g \
  --cpus=2 \
  --cpuset-cpus=0,1 \
  --storage-opt size=10G \
  nginx
```

Without proper limits, containers might consume excessive resources. Here's how to check resource usage:

```bash
# View container resource usage statistics
docker stats

# View specific container stats
docker stats my-container
```

Sample output:

```
CONTAINER ID   NAME          CPU %     MEM USAGE / LIMIT     MEM %     NET I/O           BLOCK I/O         PIDS
1a2b3c4d5e6f   web-server    0.07%     21.48MiB / 7.772GiB   0.27%     1.45kB / 0B       0B / 0B           2
```

## Container Configuration

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are a powerful way to configure containers without modifying the image. They allow you to:

- Pass configuration parameters
- Set application modes (development, production)
- Store sensitive information (though secrets are preferred)

Setting environment variables:

```bash
# Set environment variables when creating a container
docker run -e DB_HOST=localhost -e DB_PORT=5432 postgres

# Multiple environment variables from a file
docker run --env-file ./config.env postgres
```

Example `config.env` file:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=admin
DB_PASSWORD=secure_password
```

Inside the container, access these variables with:

```bash
# In bash
echo $DB_HOST

# In Python
import os
db_host = os.environ.get('DB_HOST', 'localhost')
```

### Port Mapping

Port mapping allows container services to be accessible from the host machine or external network:

```bash
# Map container port 80 to host port 8080
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx

# Map multiple ports
docker run -p 8080:80 -p 8443:443 nginx

# Map to specific interface
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80 nginx

# Map to a random host port
docker run -p 127.0.0.1::80 nginx
```

To verify port mappings:

```bash
docker port my-container
```

### Volume Mounting

Volumes provide persistent storage for containers and facilitate data sharing:

```bash
# Mount a host directory to a container path
docker run -v /host/directory:/container/path nginx

# Use a named volume
docker volume create my-data
docker run -v my-data:/container/path nginx

# Read-only mount
docker run -v /host/config:/container/config:ro nginx
```

Example use case:

```bash
# Create a persistent database volume
docker volume create postgres-data

# Run PostgreSQL with persistent data
docker run -d \
  --name postgres-db \
  -v postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
  postgres
```

### Container Networking

Container networking enables communication between containers and external systems:

**Network Types:**

- **Bridge**: Default isolated network (containers can communicate)
- **Host**: Container shares host's network (no isolation)
- **None**: No networking
- **Overlay**: Multi-host networking (for swarm/cluster environments)
- **Macvlan**: Assigns MAC address to container (appears as physical device)

```bash
# Create a custom network
docker network create my-network

# Run container in specific network
docker run --network=my-network nginx

# Connect existing container to network
docker network connect my-network my-container

# Inspect network
docker network inspect my-network
```

Example of connecting two containers:

```bash
# Create a network
docker network create app-network

# Run a database in the network
docker run -d --name db --network app-network postgres

# Run an application that connects to the database
docker run -d --name app --network app-network -e DB_HOST=db my-application
```

### Container Linking

While linking is considered legacy in favor of networks, it's still used in some environments:

```bash
# Link containers (legacy method)
docker run --name app --link db:database my-application
```

Modern approach using networks:

```bash
# Create network
docker network create app-tier

# Add containers to network
docker run -d --name redis --network app-tier redis
docker run -d --name app --network app-tier my-application
```

Inside the `app` container, you can now reach `redis` using its container name as hostname.

### Container Dependencies

Managing dependencies between containers is crucial for multi-container applications:

**Docker Compose** makes this process easier:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  database:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ['CMD-SHELL', 'pg_isready -U postgres']
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

  application:
    image: my-application
    depends_on:
      database:
        condition: service_healthy
    environment:
      DB_HOST: database
      DB_PORT: 5432
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'

volumes:
  db-data:
```

Run with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This ensures the application doesn't start until the database is healthy.

### Container Health Checks

Health checks monitor container status beyond simple "running" states:

```bash
# Add health check when creating container
docker run -d \
  --name web \
  --health-cmd="curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1" \
  --health-interval=30s \
  --health-timeout=3s \
  --health-retries=3 \
  --health-start-period=40s \
  nginx
```

In a Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM nginx
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=40s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1
```

To check health status:

```bash
docker inspect --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}' web
```

## Container Best Practices

### Security Considerations

1. **Use official images** from trusted sources
2. **Scan images** for vulnerabilities:

   ```bash
   # Install and use Trivy (popular open-source scanner)
   # First install: https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/getting-started/installation/
   trivy image nginx

   # Using Docker Hub vulnerability scanning
   # (Push your image and view scan results in Docker Hub)
   docker push yourusername/yourimage

   # Alternative: Use Clair scanner
   # First install Clair: https://github.com/quay/clair
   clair-scanner --ip <YOUR_LOCAL_IP> nginx:latest
   ```

   Note: Most container scanning tools are third-party utilities that need to be installed separately from Docker.

3. **Run containers with minimal privileges**:

   ```bash
   # Run as non-root user
   docker run --user 1000:1000 nginx

   # Drop capabilities
   docker run --cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE nginx
   ```

4. **Use read-only filesystems** where possible:

   ```bash
   docker run --read-only nginx
   ```

5. **Isolate containers** on separate networks

6. **Apply security policies** using AppArmor or SELinux:

   ```bash
   docker run --security-opt apparmor=docker-default nginx
   ```

7. **Regularly update** your base images

### Performance Optimization

1. **Use lightweight base images**:

   ```dockerfile
   # Instead of full Ubuntu
   FROM ubuntu:20.04

   # Use Alpine
   FROM alpine:3.14

   # Or distroless
   FROM gcr.io/distroless/static-debian11
   ```

2. **Optimize layers** in Dockerfiles:

   ```dockerfile
   # Bad: Multiple RUN commands
   RUN apt-get update
   RUN apt-get install -y package1
   RUN apt-get install -y package2

   # Good: Single RUN command
   RUN apt-get update && \
       apt-get install -y package1 package2 && \
       apt-get clean && \
       rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
   ```

3. **Use multi-stage builds** to reduce image size:

   ```dockerfile
   # Build stage
   FROM node:16 AS build
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY package*.json ./
   RUN npm ci
   COPY . .
   RUN npm run build

   # Production stage
   FROM nginx:alpine
   COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
   ```

4. **Leverage caching** during builds:

   ```dockerfile
   # Copy package files first
   COPY package*.json ./
   RUN npm install

   # Then copy source code (changes less frequently)
   COPY . .
   ```

5. **Use appropriate resource limits** as discussed earlier

### Logging and Monitoring

1. **Configure proper logging drivers**:

   ```bash
   # Use json-file with size limits
   docker run --log-driver=json-file --log-opt max-size=10m --log-opt max-file=3 nginx

   # Or send logs to syslog
   docker run --log-driver=syslog nginx
   ```

2. **Collect metrics** using monitoring tools:

   - Prometheus + Grafana
   - cAdvisor
   - Datadog

3. **Implement centralized logging**:
   - ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
   - Graylog
   - Fluentd/Fluent Bit

Example with Fluentd:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  app:
    image: my-app
    logging:
      driver: fluentd
      options:
        fluentd-address: localhost:24224
        tag: app.{{.Name}}

  fluentd:
    image: fluentd
    ports:
      - '24224:24224'
    volumes:
      - ./fluentd/conf:/fluentd/etc
```

4. **Set up alerts** for critical container events

### Error Handling

1. **Use proper exit codes** in your applications

2. **Configure restart policies**:

   ```bash
   # Restart on failure
   docker run --restart=on-failure:5 nginx

   # Always restart
   docker run --restart=always nginx

   # Restart unless explicitly stopped
   docker run --restart=unless-stopped nginx
   ```

3. **Implement graceful shutdown**:

   ```dockerfile
   # Example for Node.js app
   CMD ["node", "server.js"]

   # In server.js
   process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
     console.log('Received SIGTERM, shutting down gracefully');
     server.close(() => {
       console.log('Server closed');
       process.exit(0);
     });
   });
   ```

4. **Add health checks** as discussed earlier

5. **Set up backups** for critical data:
   ```bash
   # Backup a volume
   docker run --rm -v postgres-data:/source -v /backup:/backup alpine \
     tar -czf /backup/postgres-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz -C /source .
   ```
