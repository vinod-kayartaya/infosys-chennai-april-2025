You can use your host OS directory as NFS storage. An NFS server isn't a special type of server - it's simply a regular computer that runs NFS server software.

Here's how you can set up your own host OS as an NFS server:

## Setting Up an NFS Server on Your Host

### For Linux:

1. **Install the NFS server package**:

   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server

   # CentOS/RHEL
   sudo yum install nfs-utils
   ```

2. **Create or choose a directory to share**:

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /home/vinod/my-nfs-folder
   ```

3. **Configure access permissions**:

   ```bash
   sudo chown nobody:nogroup /home/vinod/my-nfs-folder
   sudo chmod 777 /home/vinod/my-nfs-folder  # Or more restrictive permissions as needed
   ```

4. **Configure the NFS exports file**:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/exports
   ```

   Add a line like:

   ```
   /home/vinod/my-nfs-folder *(ro,sync,wdelay,hide,nocrossmnt,secure,root_squash,no_all_squash,no_subtree_check,secure_locks,acl,no_pnfs,anonuid=65534,anongid=65534,sec=sys,ro,secure,root_squash,no_all_squash)

   ```

5. **Apply the configuration and start the service**:
   ```bash
   sudo exportfs -a
   sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
   ```

## Using Your Host NFS Share with Docker

Once your NFS server is running on your host, you can use its IP address (or localhost/127.0.0.1 in some setups) to mount volumes:

```bash
docker volume create --driver local \
  --opt type=nfs \
  --opt o=addr=192.168.1.100,rw \
  --opt device=:/home/vinod/my-nfs-folder \
  my-host-nfs-volume

docker run -v my-host-nfs-volume:/data my-image
```

## Key Points

- Your regular host OS can function as an NFS server with the right software
- The setup is fairly straightforward and doesn't require specialized hardware
- For development and testing, using your host as an NFS server works great
- For production environments, you might want a dedicated NFS server for better performance and reliability
