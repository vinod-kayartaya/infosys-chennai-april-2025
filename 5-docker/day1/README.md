| **Management**     | Docker CLI, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, etc.                             | Hypervisor management tools (vCenter, Hyper-V Manager)                   |
| **Networking**     | Virtualized networking, often NAT by default                             | Full network stack virtualization with more options                      |
| **Use Cases**      | Microservices, CI/CD, development environments                           | Legacy applications, different OS requirements, stronger isolation needs |

Key aspects of Docker:

- **Containerization**: Docker packages applications and dependencies into standardized containers that can run anywhere
- **Isolation**: Each container runs in isolation from other containers and the host system
- **Portability**: Containers can run on any system that has Docker installed, regardless of the underlying infrastructure
- **Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS kernel and are more lightweight than traditional virtual machines
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale applications by running multiple containers
- **Version Control**: Container images can be versioned and rolled back if needed

Docker helps solve the "it works on my machine" problem by ensuring consistent environments from development through production.

### Configuration

1. Basic Configuration

   - Docker daemon settings: Configure core Docker daemon behavior through the daemon.json file, including default runtime, registry mirrors, and logging drivers. This file is typically located at /etc/docker/daemon.json and allows you to customize how the Docker daemon operates.

   - Network configuration: Set up Docker's networking capabilities including bridge networks, overlay networks, and port mappings. This determines how containers communicate with each other and the outside world. You can create custom networks for container isolation and specify DNS settings.

   - Storage driver selection: Choose the appropriate storage driver (overlay2, devicemapper, etc.) based on your OS and requirements. The storage driver controls how images and containers are stored and managed on disk, affecting performance and functionality.

   - Resource limits (CPU, memory): Define default resource constraints for containers to prevent resource exhaustion. This includes setting CPU shares, memory limits, and swap space to ensure containers don't overwhelm the host system.

   - Logging options: Configure logging drivers and options to determine how container logs are collected, stored and rotated. Options include json-file, syslog, journald among others, with configurable log size and retention policies.

2. Security Configuration

   - TLS encryption setup: Enable and configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) for secure communication between Docker client and daemon. This involves generating certificates, configuring the daemon to use TLS, and setting up client authentication.

   - User namespace mapping: Configure user namespace remapping to enhance container isolation by mapping container user IDs to different host IDs. This provides an additional security layer by limiting container privileges on the host.

   - Security profiles: Implement security profiles like AppArmor or SELinux to enforce access controls and container isolation. These profiles define what resources and capabilities containers can access.

   - Access controls: Set up user and group permissions, role-based access control (RBAC), and authentication mechanisms to control who can perform Docker operations. This includes managing Docker group membership and API access.

3. Registry Configuration

   - Mirror settings: Configure registry mirrors to cache and speed up image pulls from remote registries. This can significantly improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage in multi-host deployments.

   - Authentication: Set up authentication for private registries including credential helpers and login configuration. This ensures secure access to private container images and prevents unauthorized access.

   - Proxy configuration: Configure HTTP/HTTPS proxies for Docker to access registries through corporate firewalls or network restrictions. This includes setting up certificates and proxy environment variables.

   - Insecure registry handling: Configure Docker to work with registries that don't use HTTPS or have self-signed certificates. While not recommended for production, this may be needed in development environments.

4. Performance Tuning

   - Cache settings: Optimize build and layer caching to speed up image builds and reduce disk usage. This includes configuring cache drivers, pruning policies, and build-time cache settings.

   - Container limits: Fine-tune container resource limits including CPU scheduling, memory allocation, and I/O priorities. This helps ensure optimal resource utilization and prevent container interference.

   - Storage optimization: Implement storage optimization strategies including image layering, multi-stage builds, and regular cleanup of unused images and containers. This helps manage disk space and improve build performance.

   - Network performance: Optimize container networking through proper driver selection, network segmentation, and traffic control settings. This includes tuning MTU sizes, implementing load balancing, and managing network policies.

5. Integration Setup

   - Kubernetes enablement: Configure Docker to work with Kubernetes, including setting up kubeadm, enabling required plugins, and configuring container runtime interface (CRI). This allows seamless integration with Kubernetes orchestration.

   - Docker Compose installation: Set up Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications, including version selection and plugin configuration. This enables declarative application deployment and management.

   - CI/CD system configuration: Integrate Docker with CI/CD pipelines including registry authentication, build caching, and artifact management. This ensures smooth automated build and deployment processes.

   - Monitoring tool setup: Configure monitoring and logging tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack for container visibility. This includes setting up metrics collection, log aggregation, and alerting systems.
